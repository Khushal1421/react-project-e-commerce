> Note that justify variants and align variants are similar with just some differece
    Align-items work for both flex and grid ; with flex works only if we have applied Wrap whereas Justify-Items only work for Grid
    In General align all variants accept flex whereas Justify-content is the only one which works on Flex
    SEE IN MORE DETAILS LATER!!!!!

            WishListData1.map((wishlist,i) =>( // in ( which is next to arrow earlier I used { and it didn't worked
                       <WishCard key={i} {...wishlist} />

    i think it works cuz in JS Array , we can push any elements (even object)

Padding:- increases gap b/w content and border (like I did in WishList Add-To-Cart)
?, && Operator are Important for Conditional Rendering


{ // It's imp 
              CartData.map((cartdata,index) => (
                 <CartCard key={index} {...cartdata} />
               )
              )
               
          }

I think I should find other ways also to do a PARTICULAR THING

npm uninstall --save-dev gh-pages
pnpm add -D gh-pages (it's used with pnpm . why this difference/)
