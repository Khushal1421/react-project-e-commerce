> Note that justify variants and align variants are similar with just some differece
    Align-items work for both flex and grid ; with flex works only if we have applied Wrap whereas Justify-Items only work for Grid
    In General align all variants accept flex whereas Justify-content is the only one which works on Flex

            WishListData1.map((wishlist,i) =>( // in ( which is next to arrow earlier I used { and it didn't worked
                       <WishCard key={i} {...wishlist} />
                   ))

    i think it works cuz in JS Array , we can push any elements (even object)

Padding:- increases gap b/w content and border (like I did in WishList Add-To-Cart)
?, && Operator are Important for Conditional Rendering


{ // It's imp 
              CartData.map((cartdata,index) => (
                 <CartCard key={index} {...cartdata} />
               )
              )
               
          }

I think I should find other ways also to do a PARTICULAR THING

npm uninstall --save-dev gh-pages
pnpm add -D gh-pages (it's used with pnpm . why this difference/)
overflow-x-auto (shows Scrollbar ; Cart.jsx STUDY DEEPLY)
group on parent and group-hover on child to show hover Effect

The overflow-auto class is a Tailwind utility class that is used to add scrollbars to an element 
when its content overflows the bounds of that element. Unlike overflow-scroll, which always shows scrollbars, 
this utility will only show them if scrolling is necessary. Here's how to use it: <div class="

flex-grow (flex:1 in tailwind) [it's used in Contact.jsx (to grow input acc. to screen size)]
The flex:1 property is a shorthand for the flex-grow property, one of the many properties 
that can be used to control the layout of elements within a flex container. 
The flex-grow property specifies how much of the available space 
within a container an element should take up, relative to the other elements.

w-[%] can help expand proportionally when we INCREASE Screen Size
width:height ratio (Or aspect ratio) [LOOK INTO IT]

The <textarea> tag defines a multi-line text input control. The <textarea> element is often used 
in a form, to collect user inputs like comments or reviews. (Used in Contacts.jsx) 
I was using input type="text" earlier
[Also look for type
in other places ]

Inconsistent Image Aspect Ratio can wither Image
Aspect ratio is proportional relationship b/w Width and Height of an Element (like image , video, or Container)
aspect ratio = width : height; [It ensures Consistency in Layouts; prevents strectching images/videos and helpful in  maintainimng responsiveness]
There are various ways to do it (Look for them)

No, a standard radio button, by design, cannot be deselected once it has been selected within its group. 
The purpose of a radio button is to allow users to choose only one option from a set, and selecting a new button automatically deselects the previously chosen one

I can't change CheckBox border via rounded-full cuz Checkbox are native form elememt and have their own styles which are applied by the Browswer
(called "user agent styles")
These styles ofte ovveridde or ignore CSS classes like padding, border, appearance etc

In Radio Button having same name is necessary to Select one of The Radio Box 
(Once Selected - a radio box can't be unselected )
If U wanna deselect, use CheckBox

<Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} /> I think in case if someone types in wrong url

With HashRouter if u have used /cart
 http://localhost:5173/react-project-e-commerce/#/cart
