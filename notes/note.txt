    Justify-Content
     What it does:
       Aligns the entire group of items (content) within the container.
        Used to distribute space between or around items.

     🧭 Axis:
       Main axis (horizontal in row-direction, vertical in column-direction)

     📦 Applies to:
       Flexbox containers
       Grid containers

       .container {
        display: grid; /* or flex */
        justify-content: center;
       }

    Justify-items
     What it does:
       Aligns each item’s content within its own cell (grid area).
       Sets the default horizontal alignment of all items inside a grid container.

     🧭 Axis:
       Inline axis (usually horizontal)

     📦 Applies to:
       Grid containers only

          .container {
           display: grid;
           justify-items: start;
          }

    Justify-Self

     What it does:
       Aligns a single item's content within its own grid area.

     Overrides justify-items for that one item.

     🧭 Axis:
       Inline axis (usually horizontal)

     📦 Applies to:
       Grid items only

justify-**content** → Aligns the group.

justify-**items** → Aligns each item by default.

justify-**self** → Aligns one item individually.



What's the difference align-items , align-content and align-self?


ChatGPT said:
Great follow-up! Let's break down the difference between align-items, align-content, and align-self — they’re similar to the justify-* properties but apply to vertical alignment (cross axis) in most cases.

🔹 1. align-items
✅ What it does:
Aligns items inside the container along the cross axis (usually vertical).

Sets the default vertical alignment for all child items.

🧭 Axis:
Cross axis (vertical in row-direction, horizontal in column-direction)

📦 Applies to:
Flex containers

Grid containers

🔧 Example:

.container {
  display: flex; /* or grid */
  align-items: center;
}
All child items are vertically centered within the container or their cells.

🔸 2. align-content
✅ What it does:
Aligns multiple lines of items as a group inside the container.

Only works when there’s wrapping or multiple rows/columns (like flex-wrap: wrap or grid with multiple tracks).

🧭 Axis:
Cross axis

📦 Applies to:
Flex containers (with wrap)

Grid containers

🔧 Example:

.container {
  display: grid; /* or flex with wrap */
  align-content: space-between;
}
The rows or lines of content are distributed with space between them.

🔸 3. align-self
✅ What it does:
Aligns a single item on the cross axis.

Overrides the align-items setting for that specific item.

🧭 Axis:
Cross axis

📦 Applies to:
Flex items

Grid items

🔧 Example:
css
Copy
Edit
.item {
  align-self: flex-end;
}
This specific item aligns to the bottom (or end) of its container or cell.

align-**items** → Aligns all items.

align-**content** → Aligns the group of lines.

align-**self** → Aligns a single item.
